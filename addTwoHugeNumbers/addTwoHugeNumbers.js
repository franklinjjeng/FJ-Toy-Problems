/*
Given two linked lists that represent a large number,
add them together and represent it as a linked list

example:
// it should be noted taht the arrays are representations of a linked list with structure node.value and node.next
For a = [9876, 5432, 1999] and b = [1, 8001], the output should be
addTwoHugeNumbers(a, b) = [9876, 5434, 0].

Explanation: 987654321999 + 18001 = 987654340000.

For a = [123, 4, 5] and b = [100, 100, 100], the output should be
addTwoHugeNumbers(a, b) = [223, 104, 105].

Explanation: 12300040005 + 10001000100 = 22301040105.
