Shortest Sub-array Containing Maximum Degree
Given an array of numbers, the degrees is the number of times the same number shows up. For example: [1, 2, 2, 3] would have a max degree of two as 2 appears twice. Find the shortest length sub-array containing the maximum number of degrees.

example:
input: [2, 2, 3, 1, 3]
output: 2
explanation: The maximum number of degrees is two as 2 and 3 both appear twice.
The sub-arrays containing the maximum degrees are [2, 2] and [3, 1, 3].
The shortest sub-array length is found to be two.
